# watch-simpsons

Picking a random episode of the Simpsons to watch is hard, so I wrote an application to do it for me.

A random episode is selected based on a path that's defined in the environment. A media player of the user's choice is also be set in the environment (e.g. VLC or mpv), along with any flags they'd like passed to the player (e.g. `--fullscreen`).
